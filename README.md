## Objective of this Assignment:

<b>A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing</b> has decided to enter the Australian market.<br>
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house?
1. How well those variables describe the price of a house?

### Business Goal:
Build an optimized model to identify the key predictor variables, so that Surprise Housing's management can understand
- how prices vary with these key predictor variables
- how to manipulate their strategy to yield high returns
- understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

### Technical Goal:
- In addition to building the model, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
